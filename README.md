#Project - Tutorial Game Created using Brackeys Tutorial

Game Name - Floria

Tutorial game created by the help of Brackeys tutorial, consisted of 1-2 weeks of creating/modifying.  A great and fun experience to help dive into coding games.  I had created it months ago but had forgottent to upload it.

BASICS ADDED

-- Use of C# in scripts 
-- Applied physics to show Force of objects, Pull of objects, Jump Movement etc
-- Added environment to give more feeling to the game (Trees, Snow biome, Desert etc in updated version)
-- Created an Icon and app for the game on my Desktop working as intended
-- Camera system following the users object
-- Added End Screens to show the games ending 
-- When players hit an obstacle, resets the level
-- Made the player fast but not too fast using the C# in PlayerMovement Script

LEVEL SYSTEM

-- Added level 1 being the easiest to make sure players get the hang of of the game
-- Level 2 increases difficulty a little
-- Level 3 being the final level and little more difficult
-- Game screen for when a level is completed



All credit goes to Brackey! I was able to learn and play around for 1 week to add and modify however I wanted.
